 2) (20  points) Instrumentation Tab:
 In the instrumentation tab, create the following elements:
	•	A labeled UITextField for number of rows accompanied by a UIStepper in units of 10
	•	A labeled UITextField for number of columns accompanies by a UIStepper in units of 10
	•	A labeled UISlider for refresh rate allowing values from 0.1 to 10 Hz
	•	A labeled UISwitch which allows timed refresh to be turned on or off
 Make sure that layout looks good on all size classes with no warning messages.  All fonts and UI elements should be neatly  arranged and centered horizontally and vertically.
